# Diabetes Classification with Scikit-Learn

[![Datmo Model](https://beta.datmo.io/shabazp/diabetes-classification/badge.svg)](http://beta.datmo.io/shabazp/diabetes-classification)

This is an example of a Datmo model which uses a dataset of patient attributes and predicts the likelihood of a patient having diabetes

You can take a look at the Dataset details [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#datasets) 

Check out the Snapshots tab for information on snapshots that were taken with various parameters. Search and filter them to find the best ones. 

Click on the "Deploy" button next to the relevant snapshot to create an API on the server the Agent is running on or use the deploy command in the CLI to deploy it as a RESTful API (microservice deployment coming soon :)
